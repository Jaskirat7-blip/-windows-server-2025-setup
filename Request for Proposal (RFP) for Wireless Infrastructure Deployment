## About Us
The organization "IT Solution" is  passionate about enhancing connectivity and streamlining operations. The organization is  looking for experienced vendors to help us design, implement, and manage a cutting-edge wireless network that adheres to the latest industry standards while boosting our network's overall performance and reliability.
## Project Scope

### Objectives
- Create a dependable and high-speed wireless network that covers all areas of the office.
- Ensure smooth integration with the current wired network setup.
- Implement strong security protocols to safeguard data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Offer ongoing monitoring and support to maintain optimal network performance.

### Scope of Work

1. Site Survey
- Perform an in-depth site survey to evaluate the physical layout and specific network needs.
- Determine the best locations for access points to ensure broad coverage and reduce interference.

2. Installation and Configuration
- Set up and configure wireless access points (APs) to ensure consistent coverage throughout the office.
- Seamlessly integrate the wireless network with the existing wired infrastructure, ensuring smooth transitions between the two networks.

3. Security Implementation
- Set up WPA3 encryption and apply MAC address filtering to enhance network security.
- Enable secure guest access and implement robust user authentication methods to safeguard the network.

4. Performance Optimization
- Ensure the network can handle heavy usage without delays or performance issues.
- Fine-tune channels and manage bandwidth to maximize network efficiency and minimize congestion.

5. Ongoing Maintenance and Support
- Regularly update software and manage patches to keep the network secure and efficient.
- Continuously monitor network performance and resolve any issues as soon as they arise.
- Provide a service-level agreement (SLA) that ensures timely issue resolution and ongoing support.

## Requirements

### Coverage
- Ensure complete wireless coverage across all office areas, including meeting rooms and common spaces.
- Minimize dead zones and interference to maintain stable connections.

### Capacity
- Support at least 500 simultaneous connections without any noticeable impact on performance.
- Implement load balancing and bandwidth management to effectively handle peak usage times.

### Security
- Use WPA3 encryption for enhanced security.
- Apply MAC address filtering to restrict unauthorized devices.
- Provide secure guest network access with isolated VLANs for better control.
- Implement Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for internal users to add an extra layer of protection.

### Management
- Enable centralized monitoring and reporting of the networkâ€™s performance.
- Provide remote management and troubleshooting support to resolve issues efficiently.

## Vendor Qualifications

### Experience
- At least 3 years of experience in designing and implementing wireless infrastructure.
- Provide details of at least two previous projects that are similar in scope and complexity.

### Certifications
- The vendor should have certifications in network security and wireless infrastructure, such as Cisco, CompTIA, or CWNP.

### References
-  Vendors should submit a minimum of three references from clients who have worked for similar projects.
-  Vendors should give contact details and a brief description of the work they have carried out for these clients.
